üáÆüá≥ Overview of India‚Äôs Economy

India is the fifth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and the
third-largest by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). It functions as a mixed
economy, where both private enterprise and government play active roles

is the most populous nation and one of the fastest-growing major
economies. Its economic growth is fueled by domestic consumption,
services, industrial production, agriculture, and digital innovation.
India is often described as a rising global power due to its demographic
dividend, technological adoption, and expanding role in international
trade and policy.
